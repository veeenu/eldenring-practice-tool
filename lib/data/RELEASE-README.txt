Welcome to the Elden Ring Practice Tool!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Getting started

- Extract all files from the zip archive. Anywhere will do.
- Double-click `eldenring.exe` to start the game (Steam → right click **ELDEN
  RING** → Manage → Browse Local Files). Never start the game from Steam: the tool won't work.
- Double-click `jdsd_er_practice_tool.exe` and pick an option.

# Run the tool

The tool will automatically appear over the game. Press `0` to open and close its interface.

# Install/update the tool

Just follow the instructions on screen.
This will install/update the tool next to your `eldenring.exe` game. 

Once you have installed the tool, you will be able to start it by holding down the right shift key
for a few seconds while the game is loading. You can also continue using the executable to start it.

If you don't want to load the tool, just don't hold right shift during startup!
