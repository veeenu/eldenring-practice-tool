Welcome to the Elden Ring Practice Tool!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can run the practice tool in two ways.

# Standalone

- Extract all files from the zip archive. Anywhere will do.
- Double-click `eldenring.exe` to start the game (Steam → right click **ELDEN
  RING** → Manage → Browse Local Files). Never start the game from Steam: the tool won't work.
- Double-click `jdsd_er_practice_tool.exe`.

The tool will automatically appear over the game. Press `0` to open and close its interface.

# Installed
- Extract all files from the zip archive _to your Elden Ring `Game` folder_ (Steam → right click 
  **ELDEN RING** → Manage → Browse Local Files). The files must be in the same folder as 
  `eldenring.exe`.
- Double-click `eldenring.exe`.
- Press the right shift button and keep it pressed for a few seconds until the tool appears on 
  screen.

If you don't want to load the tool, just don't press right shift during startup!
