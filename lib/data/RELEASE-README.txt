Welcome to the Elden Ring Practice Tool!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can run the practice tool in two ways.

By double-clicking `jdsd_er_practice_tool.exe`:
  - Bypass EAC with the `steam_appid.txt` method.
  - Double-click `jdsd_er_practice_tool.exe` while the game is running.

By installing the DLL:
  - Bypass EAC with the `steam_appid.txt` method.
  - Rename `jdsd_er_practice_tool.dll` to `dinput8.dll`. Make sure your file extensions are 
    visible to ensure you are naming the file correctly.
  - Copy `dinput8.dll` and `jdsd_er_practice_tool.toml` to you Elden Ring Game folder. The
    files must be in the same folder as `eldenring.exe`.
  - Start Elden Ring normally.
  - While it is starting, press and hold right shift for a few seconds, until the tool appears.

Please note that if you want to use both methods, you need to keep two separate copies: the exe
will not start the tool if the DLL has been renamed to dinput8.dll.
