A tool for practicing speedruns. It is compatible with all Elden Ring patches.

Made with ❤️ by [johndisandonato](https://twitch.tv/johndisandonato).

The tool is free, and will always be free, but maintaining it requires a significant effort.

## Getting started

Download the **latest stable release** [here](https://github.com/veeenu/eldenring-practice-tool/releases/latest).

### Prerequisites

- Steam must be open. Offline mode is fine, but the program must be started.
- Antiviruses are disabled. This includes Windows Defender.
- You have a legitimate copy of the game. Pirated copies will never be supported.
- EAC is [bypassed](https://soulsspeedruns.com/eldenring/eac-bypass/) with the textfile method.
Other methods aren't supported and could make it impossible to run the tool.

The tool will apply the bypass for you on the first run, so it is recommended not to do it
manually.

### Running the tool

- Extract all files from the zip archive. Anywhere will do.
- Double-click `eldenring.exe` to start the game (Steam -> right click ELDEN
  RING -> Manage -> Browse Local Files). Never start it from Steam -- the tool won't work.
- Double-click `jdsd_er_practice_tool.exe`.

The tool will automatically appear over the game. Press `0` to open and close its interface.

### Help

If the tool doesn't work, you need help, or want to get in touch, read the [troubleshooting guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
